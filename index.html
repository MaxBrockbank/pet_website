  <h1>My dog's name is Nigel!</h1>
  <p>Nigel is an Australian Labradoodle and is three years old. His hobbies include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sleeping</li>
    <li>Puking</li>
    <li>Eating most things (a large reason why he pukes)</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Having a big ol' fit in public</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Labradoodles are long-haired dogs, so they need constant brushing or else they get matted and have to get shaved. When this happens... it's quite unfortunate. Your furry friend turns into a gross little rat thing and is cold all the time. It takes months to grow back to their glorious self. I'm not very good at keeping up on the brushing so this has happened to Nigel about three times. Hopefully it won't happen a fourth.</p>
